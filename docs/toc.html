        <p>
          By using the App, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
          If you use the App on behalf of another person or entity, you represent that you have authority to bind them to these Terms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="who-we-are">2) Who we are</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Developer / Publisher:</strong> Catadoo (individual developer; not a registered company)</p>
        <p><strong>Individual:</strong> Pavle Prodanović</p>

      <h2 id="app-purpose">3) App purpose (Aggregator; no affiliation)</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The App is an <strong>aggregator</strong> that helps users discover and access various third-party games/apps (each a “Third-Party App”).
          The App may display information about Third-Party Apps (such as names, logos, and descriptions) and may provide links to Third-Party Apps’ websites.
        </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p>
          <strong>No affiliation.</strong> Unless explicitly stated otherwise, Catadoo and the App are <strong>not affiliated with, endorsed by,
          sponsored by, or otherwise connected to</strong> the owners, developers, or publishers of any Third-Party App.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trademarks.</strong> Third-Party App names, logos, and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. Use of such marks
          in the App is for identification, reference, and informational purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accuracy.</strong> We gather and curate App listings and related information ourselves. We try to keep information accurate and
          up to date, but we do not guarantee completeness, timeliness, or accuracy.
        </p>

        <div class="hr"></div>

        <p>
          <strong>Requests from rights holders.</strong> If you are a rights holder and believe content in the App infringes your rights,
          is inaccurate, or you want your listing modified or removed, contact us at
          <a href="mailto:catadook@gmail.com">catadook@gmail.com</a> with sufficient details (e.g., the app name, link, and the requested change).
          We will review requests in good faith and may update or remove content at our discretion.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="external-services">4) External links &amp; third-party services</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The App may link to Third-Party Apps and websites. When you click a link, you leave the App environment and interact with a third party
          that we do not control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for third-party content, products, services, availability, policies, or practices. Your use of any third-party
          site or app is governed by that third party’s terms and policies.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="ip">5) Intellectual property &amp; attributions</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>5.1 Our content</h3>
        <p>
          The App’s code, design, layout, and original content created by us (including our original descriptions and organization of listings)
          are owned by Catadoo / Pavle Prodanović or licensed to us, and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Third-party content</h3>
        <p>
          Third-Party App logos, names, and any third-party materials displayed in the App remain the property of their respective owners.
          We do not claim ownership over them.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Attribution</h3>
        <p>
          The App may include assets (for example, SVG icons) that require attribution. Where applicable, we will provide credits in the App,
          on our website, and/or in an accompanying “Credits” or “Attributions” page.
        </p>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
          The App may offer a voluntary “support” option that allows you to watch an optional rewarded advertisement or visit a donation page
          (for example, Ko-fi). There is no subscription or paid feature required to use the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ads are provided by third-party ad networks (such as Google AdMob). Donation platforms are third-party services. Your interactions with
          these services are governed by their own terms and policies.

        </p>
        <p>
          We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of information about Third-Party Apps. Third-Party Apps and websites are
          not under our control and may change at any time.
        </p>
      </div>

          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
